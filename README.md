Grading Notes:   
In addition to documented problems:   
It doesn't accurately show current state of settings (all color buttons are highlighted). See the assignment sheet and notes from our discussion of the assignment; you can't read/write a Color object to file   
Allows drawing off of top/right border   
Don't put non-destruction code in the destructor; standard functions should do expected thing  
Very inefficient in draw() function; get a ptr/reference to existing vector, no need to create a duplicate every time draw() is called   
Grade: 44/50
